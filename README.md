# My first Flutter program

#### This is a simple Flutter application that displays a single screen with a title and a message. Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the code does:
This is my learning repository. I use this program to learn Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications. In this project, I demonstrate how to use Flutter widgets, state management, navigation, animations, and more. You can run this programs on Android or iOS devices.
## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## About The Code
 `import 'package:flutter/material.dart';`
#### This line imports the material package, which is used to build UI components in Flutter.

`
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}`
#### This is the entry point of the application. It runs the runApp() function, which takes an instance of the MyApp class and starts the application.
~~~
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text("Title"),
          backgroundColor: Colors.amber,
        ),
        body: Text("Hello World"
        ),
      ),
    );  
  }
} 
~~~

#### This is the `MyApp` class, which is a `StatelessWidget` that defines the UI for the application. It returns a `MaterialApp` widget, which is the root of the widget tree. The` MaterialApp` widget takes a home parameter, which is a `Scaffold` widget that defines the basic layout of the screen. The `Scaffold` widget has an `appBar` property, which is an `AppBar` widget that displays a `title` and a `background color`. The `Scaffold` widget also has a `body` property, which is a `Text` widget that displays the message `"Hello World"`.
